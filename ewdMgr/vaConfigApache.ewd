<h3>Configuring and Managing Apache</h3>

In Ubuntu 7.10, Apache's configuration and management files and directories are in somewhat unusual places compared with other Linux distributions.  
 Here's where to find most things that you'll need:<br><br>

<table border=1>
 <tr>
  <td>Main configuration file</td>
  <td>/etc/apache2/apache2.conf</td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
  <td>Root directory</td>
  <td>/var/www</td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
  <td>Where the root directory is defined</td>
  <td>/etc/apache2/sites-available/default</td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
  <td>Location of cgi-bin directory</td>
  <td>usr/lib/cgi-bin</td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
  <td>To restart Apache</td>
  <td>sudo /etc/init.d/apache2 restart<br><br>
      Note: leave out <i>sudo</i> if logged in as root
  </td>
 </tr>
</table>
