<h3>Configured Usernames</h3>

Two usernames have been set up:  <i>root</i> and <i>ewd</i>.<br><br>  

Both have an initial password of <i>1234567</i>.  <i>ewd</i> has sudo privelege.  Both usernames can be used to access the Virtual Appliance via SSH.  
 To access the Virtual Appliance using SSH from a Windows PC, we recommend using 
 <i><a href="http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/download.html" target="putty">puTTY</a></i> and 
 <i><a href="http://winscp.net/eng/index.php" target="winscp">WinSCP</a></i>.  
 Most day-to-day access will be done via the browser interface.  
 Just point a browser at the IP address of the Virtual Appliance, eg <i>http://192.168.1.21</i><br><br>
