  <div id="compiler_settings" class="alertPanelOff">
    This section tells EWD where to find the source page directories, and defines 
    the default compiler settings.  It is recommended that you do not change these settings 
    unless you are an advanced user and fully familiar with EWD, GT.M and MGWSI/<i>m_apache</i>.
  </div>
  <div id="app_src_path" class="alertPanelOff">
    The file path/ directory under which all your source EWD application directories reside. 
    This parameter is essential for EWD to be able to locate where your EWD source files are held.
  </div>
  <div id="web_tech" class="alertPanelOff">
    The run-time web technology to which EWD will compile your pages by default.
  </div>
  <div id="script_tech" class="alertPanelOff">
    The pre-page and action scripts in your EWD pages can be written in a variety of languages.  This 
    parameter defines the default that EWD's compiler will expect to find in your source pages.
  </div>
  <div id="persist_db" class="alertPanelOff">
    EWD can use a variety of databases for its session persistence.  This parameter allows you to define 
    the default database technology that will be used for session persistence.
  </div>
  <div id="page_markup" class="alertPanelOff">
    <p>During development and testing, it is best to set this default parameter to "indented".  The markup in the 
    compiled versions of your pages will be laid out in a clearly readable format, indented where possible to reflect the XML 
    tag hierarchy within the page.</p>
    <p>Applications that are ready for production deployment should be compiled in collapsed mode which removes 
    white space wherever possible, both within your markup and Javascript code.  This makes the application use 
    network bandwidth more efficiently, helps to obfuscate your page logic, and also may help to rectify some fine detail 
    related to styling.</p>
  </div>
  <div id="web_tech_head" class="alertPanelOff">
    This section allows you to configure EWD for each run-time web technology that you wish to use.  These settings 
    determine where EWD saves the compiled versions of your pages, and how it structures certain file references. 
    You only need to configure those technologies that you'll actually use.  It is recommended that you do not change these settings 
    unless you are an advanced user and fully familiar with EWD, GT.M and MGWSI/<i>m_apache</i>.
  </div>
  <div id="pers_dbs" class="alertPanelOff">
    EWD can use a variety of databases for its session persistence.  This section allows you to define the relevant connection 
    between your run-time web technology and the database.  In the case of Cach&eacute; or GT.M in conjunction with PHP, 
    this involves defining the <i>server name</i> connection used by the <i>MGWSI</i> gateway.  In the case of mySQL, you need to 
    specify the IP address of the mySQL server and the mySQL username and password.  If you are using GT.M/MGWSI (ie using
    <i>m_apache</i>), this section is not relevant, since session persistence automatically occurs within the GT.M
    database.  It is recommended that you do not change these settings 
    unless you are an advanced user and fully familiar with EWD, GT.M and MGWSI/<i>m_apache</i>.
